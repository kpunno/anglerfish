            <h2>Mating Habits of the <span style="color:rgb(105, 105, 185)">Anglerfish</span></h2><hr>
            <p>
                Female and male anglerfish differ greatly in size: The fanged, <a href="#terms">bioluminescent</a> females are predatory and serve as the leaders of the species. Male anglerfish are comparatively quite small; often smaller than one inch.
            </p>
            <p>
                The male anglerfish serves almost solely as a vehicle to aid in reproduction. The male uses its sharp teeth to latch onto a female.  Over time, the male releases an enzyme that assists in the <a href="#terms">fusion</a> of both parties. The male will receive sustenance from the female, and the female will receive the male’s sperm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, the male becomes completely absorbed by the female. At this point, the male has served its purpose, and the female will release its fertilized eggs to spawn more baby anglers.

            <h2>How to <span style="color:rgb(105, 105, 185)">SURVIVE</span> in the Deep Sea</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Survival is difficult in the deepest regions of the ocean. Food is scarce, and there is no light besides that which is produced by bioluminescent organisms. 
                <br><br>
                The anglerfish is lucky to have evolved to produce its own light to lure in potential prey. The anglerfish's <a href="terms">bioluminescent dorsal fin</a> acts as a bait, being one of the few entertaining things for other fish in the dark abyss.
                <br><br>
                Due to this method of predation, the anglerfish seldom has to chase its prey. Its body is bulbous and round, designed for floating rather than swimming.
                <br><br>
                As well as having a tempting light to lure unsuspecting prey; the Deep-Sea Angler's body is a dark colour, allowing it to camouflage in its environment. To those <em>unequipped</em>, they will only spot a light to guide them, and not the dangerous reality of who produced it!

            <p>
                Luckily, us humans live far, far away from the home of the Deep-Sea Anglerfish. Although they do not pose a great risk to us, it would certainly be a displeasure to meet one in person.<br><br>
                The anglerfish may not look appetizing, but in some cultures, they are considered a delicacy. The anglerfish is completely edible aside from the head and bones.<br><br>
                Anglerfish is a very lean meat, and is favoured by those who want a rich source of vitamins without being high in fats.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Rejection is a common result of same species organ fusion or unionization.
                A complication of organ transplantation in humans is the body having a negative response to the transplanted organ; and the body will not accept the new organ as a replacement to the original.<br><br>
                Deep-Sea Anglerfish are a marvel to scientists due to the parasitic nature of their reproductive ritual. It is speculated that the answers to solving the rejection complications experienced in human organ tranplantation lie in the immune system of Anglerfish.
